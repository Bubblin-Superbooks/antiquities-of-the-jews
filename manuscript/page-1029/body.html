And since all God's judgments are just, and all fit to be executed, and all at length for the good of the persons punished, I incline to think that to be the meaning of this phrase of "heaping coals of fire on their heads."]</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">[ We may note here, that how sacred soever an oath was esteemed among the people of God in old times, they did not think it obligatory</li></ol></div> </div>
