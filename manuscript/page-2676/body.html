And there are none of our customs which are inhuman, but all tending to piety, and devoted to the preservation of justice; nor do we conceal those injunctions of ours by which we govern our lives, they being memorials of piety, and of a friendly conversation among men. And the seventh day we set apart from labor; it is dedicated to the learning of our customs and laws,  we thinking it proper to reflect on them, as well as on any [good] thing else, in order to our avoiding of sin.</p></div> </div>
