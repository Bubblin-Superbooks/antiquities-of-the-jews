In the mean time, the forty baths are probably the true quantity contained in each laver, since they went upon wheels, and were to be drawn by the Levites about the courts of the priests for the washings they were designed for; and had they held much more, they would have been too heavy to have been so drawn.]</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">[ Here Josephus gives us a key to his own language, of right and left hand in the tabernacle</li></ol></div> </div>
